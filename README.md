# **JavaScript Arrays, Functions, and String Handling**

## **IFS L1T11 - Capstone Project 2: Arrays, Functions, and String Handling**

## **Description**
This is a JavaScript program that creates a cipher with arrays, functions and string handling.
It encodes an inputted string, using a Caesar Cipher format, where the inputted characters are 
shifted 15 characters ahead, rotating through the ASCII Decimal limits for lowercase and uppercase letters.

The program uses an 'if' statement and a 'for' loop with a nested 'if..else' statement to encode the text, 
and returns the encoded value or message inputted.

The output prints spaces and punctuation marks as themselves, and prints uppercase or lowercase letters as the character 
shifted ahead by 15. Example: 
  * if the inputted character is lowercase 'a', the program rotates through the ASCII Decimals between 97 and 122, 
    shifting 'a' 15 places ahead, so the encoded output would be lowercase 'p'.
  * if the inputted character is uppercase 'W', the program rotates through the ASCII decimal index between 65 and 90, 
    shifting 'W' 15 places ahead, so the encoded output would be uppercase 'L'.
